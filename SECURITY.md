## **Security Expectations**

Since this project is primarily used to deploy the **Mutillidae** platform, please keep in mind:

- **Intentional Vulnerabilities in Mutillidae**:  
  - Mutillidae is a deliberately vulnerable application meant for cybersecurity training. 
  - If the reported issue pertains to **vulnerabilities within the Mutillidae platform itself**, it may not be treated as a security issue unless it affects the **deployment process** or the **Docker configuration**.

- **Mutillidae-Docker Configuration**:  
  - Vulnerabilities related to the Docker setup, image security, exposed ports, or misconfigurations will be treated as valid security concerns.
